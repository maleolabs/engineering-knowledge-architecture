Engineering Knowledge Objects are immutable and content-addressed:
every payload row is keyed by SHA-256(unit.json || content), written
once, and never updated. This command recomputes every content-derived
value and compares it with the stored state across four verification
levels:

  1. payload-hash:    recompute SHA-256(unit.json || content) per payload
  2. payload-decode:  strict-decode every unit.json (reject-by-default)
  3. reference-target: every reference's object_hash must exist
  4. reference-index: every reference's index columns must match its
                      payload (identity tuple, revision, dimension,
                      domain, phase, canonical form)

plus attachment digests and the repository registry. Unreferenced
payloads are the immutable history archive — they are counted, never
reported as violations.

The check detects manual database modification; it does not prevent
it (SQLite is a persistence layer, not a trust boundary). A tampered
payload row stays flagged permanently — there is no repair command in
v0.2. Remediation is manual: delete the tampered row (e.g. via
sqlite3), then re-pull from a clean snapshot or re-seed with
'eka sync pull --from-docs'; the reference then points at a verified
payload and the check passes again.
