package view

// This file implements the execution projection: the canonical view of
// the Execution domain over the active execution container — the
// container itself, its tickets with the status projected from their
// work items, and its work items grouped by execution state. It merges
// the former sprint (work items by state) and wave (tickets and
// progress) projections; "sprint" and "wave" remain registered as
// aliases that resolve here, producing identical output.
//
// Derivation (see package doc for the membership rule):
//   - Target: the ACTIVE Execution Container (container-state "active";
//     exactly-one-active per protocol). No active container yields an
//     empty projection — a valid state, not an error. Several active
//     containers (invalid state) resolve to the lexicographically
//     smallest canonical identity, reported through MultipleActive.
//   - Tickets: the tickets (tkt-) whose derives-from includes the
//     active container's identity line, sorted by canonical identity,
//     each carrying the status projected from its referenced work item
//     ("unresolved" when the work item does not resolve).
//   - Members: the work items referenced by those tickets,
//     deduplicated by identity line.
//   - Grouping: fixed execution-state column order planned, todo,
//     in-progress, in-review, done.
//
// The execution projection ignores the optional target argument.

// ExecutionProjection is the Execution domain view over the active
// container.
