// Package runtime implements the EKA Runtime Kernel: the internal API
// of the EKA Knowledge Runtime (milestone EKA v0.2.0, milestone 5).
//
// The Runtime is the single entry point every consumer — the CLI
// (cmd/), and future consumers such as the Context Engine, MCP or
// Atrium — talks to. It aggregates the workspace (workspace/) and the
// canonical store (store/) behind documented, domain-shaped services:
//
//	Workspace   workspace registry, last-sync log, aggregated status
//	Knowledge   Engineering-Knowledge reads (units, object, search,
//	            counts) — NOT CRUD
//	Resolver    identity resolution (canonical form, line)
//	Relations   relationship traversal (from/to/upstream/downstream)
//	Timeline    instance-line history (change logs + hashes)
//	Snapshot    verified package reads
//	Integrity   store integrity verification + schema version
//
// and the Authoring API (authoring.go) — the stateless compiler,
// validation and sync gateway that turns authoring representations
// (Markdown is one adapter behind it, in conformance/) into Canonical
// Knowledge Objects and runtime state.
//
// Boundary contract (architecture):
//
//   - Consumers communicate ONLY through these services. Direct
//     access to workspace/ or store/ from outside this package (and
//     the internal packages it wraps: workspace, sync, store) is not
//     valid architecture — SQLite is a private implementation detail
//     of the Runtime Kernel.
//   - The Runtime API never understands Markdown: authoring input
//     reaches the kernel only through the Authoring API.
//   - The Authoring API never exposes database details: it produces
//     only CKOs (Compile), reports (Validate) or runtime state (Sync).
//
// All services are concrete types with documented method contracts —
// there are deliberately no interface types (no consumer needs
// polymorphism), and no HTTP/RPC/gRPC/REST: this milestone establishes
// the in-process API only.
