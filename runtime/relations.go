// This file implements the RelationsService: relationship traversal
// over the canonical store. The Runtime makes traversal natural —
// consumers never hand-walk relationships. Relationships live inside
// the immutable payloads (unit.Relationships, ordered by (type,
// target)); traversal resolves them against the workspace references.

// Relation is one directed relationship edge incident to a queried
// form: Type is the relationship type, Target is the canonical
// identity form of the OTHER end of the edge — the referenced unit for
// From (outgoing), the referring unit for To (incoming).
