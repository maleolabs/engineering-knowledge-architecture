# ADR-008 — Engineering Domain Model: universal domains + Knowledge Stratification

## Context

EKA v1.0 exposed methodology-specific Artifact types: PRD, ADR, Epic, Sprint, and Ticket all appear as named types, binding the standard to particular working styles. But the standard's own purpose is to model **engineering knowledge itself** — and engineering knowledge has a lifecycle (Discovery → Architecture → Planning → Execution → Operations) that the methodology vocabulary only approximates. The result: the same knowledge could be classified differently depending on the methodology in use, and authority (which knowledge wins when two artifacts disagree) had no structural home.

Core §14.2.3 settles the governance question in advance: **core closed, taxonomy open** — Identity, layer contracts, and invariants are closed to extension; taxonomies (types, dimensions, domains, protocol) are open under governance. The Engineering Domain ontology is exactly such a taxonomy extension, and it follows the taxonomy-extension governance path (proposal → review → acceptance, §14.2.5).

## Decision

1. **Five canonical Engineering Domains** — Discovery, Architecture, Planning, Execution, Operations — form the primary classification axis **above** Knowledge Dimensions (Core v1.1 §8.1, Wave 1 mapping: 26 tokens, 12 dimensions → 5 domains). Engineering Domain is a **classification property** (P15 extension): derived from the Artifact's Knowledge Dimension and token family, or declared by an extension; **never Identity**, never part of the State Vector.
2. **Knowledge Stratum** — each domain has a fixed authority stratum in the strict linear order Discovery → Architecture → Planning → Execution → Operations (1 highest → 5), always **derived**, never declared. The **Stratum Authority Invariant** binds them: lower-stratum knowledge must not contradict higher-stratum knowledge in force; contradictions are resolved through the governance channel (new instance + Relationship, forward-only), and a lower-stratum artifact must never supersede or amend a higher-stratum artifact.
3. **Type tokens remain identity-representation labels** — the 26 tokens and 12 Knowledge Dimensions are unchanged; only their classification gains a domain dimension.
4. **Methodology terms = Representation Aliases** — PRD, ADR/RFC, Epic, Initiative, Sprint/Iteration, Ticket, Release, Incident, Runbook map onto canonical tokens + domains; they are never frontmatter values and never Artifact types in their own right.
5. **Validation rules** — R10 stratification traceability (warning: non-Discovery artifacts need a resolvable derives-from/depends-on chain to a strictly higher stratum; `tkt-`/`ses-` and draft knowledge artifacts exempt), R11 domain coherence (blocking: declared `domain` must be canonical and equal the token's home domain; absent = OK), R12 cross-stratum supersession prohibition (blocking: `supersedes`/`amends` never target a strictly higher stratum; resolvable targets only).
6. **Exchange and serialization** — the Exchange Unit Classification carries the derived Engineering Domain (optional explicit declaration must match, R6); the RSF Serialization Version moves to **1.1** with the domain member plus optional Representation metadata; legacy Serialization Version **1** stays importable with domain derivation at import (RSF §11.2).

## Consequences

- **Positive**: the Core becomes methodology-independent — the same standard serves Scrum, Kanban, Shape Up, and future conventions without type churn.
- **Positive**: a simpler mental model: knowledge is classified by its position in the engineering lifecycle, and authority is a single derived linear order instead of an implicit social convention.
- **Positive**: extensible — new Artifact types and Knowledge Dimensions must declare their home Engineering Domain (Core §14.2.7), and future layers (Atrium, protocol variants) get a stable authority axis.
- **Negative**: existing strata-isolated artifacts (including this repository's own 7 ADRs, Architecture stratum 2, with no chain to Discovery) produce R10 warnings — accepted and documented; R10 never blocks.
- **Negative**: terminology migration effort — methodology names in prose, tooling, and documentation must be reframed as Representation Aliases.
- **Negative**: conformance-matrix governance debt — the R10–R12 rows of the conformance-traceability matrix remain pending governance work (see migration report §6).

## Alternatives Considered

- **Six domains adding Records or Consumption** — rejected: records/operations pair naturally inside Operations (stratum 5), and a Consumption domain would duplicate Operations without an authority distinction.
- **DAG stratification (multiple chains, partial order)** — rejected: the strict linear order is the whole point; a partial order would make the authority comparison (R10/R12) non-deterministic.
- **v2.0 breaking bump** — rejected: no canonical term redefined, no invariant weakened; Core §14.2.3 explicitly opens taxonomies to extension, so a minor taxonomy revision is the correct vehicle (migration report §5).
- **Separate Domain Specification family** — rejected: the ontology is classification vocabulary, not a specification domain; it belongs in the Core taxonomy under §8.1.
- **Top-level domain folders in the repository** — rejected: location is not classification (P15, ADR-005 `dimension == folder`); domains are derived properties, and the 12-dimension folder layout stays the serialization ground truth.
